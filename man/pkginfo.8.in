.SH NAME
pkginfo \- display software package information
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpkginfo [options]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpkginfo\fP is a \fIpackage management\fP utility, which displays
information about software packages that are installed on the system
or that reside in a particular directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-i, \-\-installed"
List installed packages and their version.
.TP
.B "\-l, \-\-list <package|file>"
List files owned by the specified <package> or contained in <file>.
.TP
.B "\-o, \-\-owner <pattern>"
List owner(s) of file(s) matching <pattern>.
.TP
.B "\-f, \-\-footprint <file>"
Print footprint for <file>. This feature is mainly used by pkgmk(8)
for creating and comparing footprints.
.TP
.B "\-O, \-\-orphans=[pattern]"
Print orphaned files, i.e. files which are present on the filesystem
but absent in the database. It's useful if you're interested in cleaning
up extraneous files.
Default exceptions pattern is:
^(dev|sys|proc|mnt|tmp|var|root|home|lost\\+found|boot|etc|lib/modules|opt|usr/var|usr/src|usr/ports|usr/local)

\fBNOTE:\fP you should use -Opattern or --orphans=pattern (not
-O pattern or --orphans pattern) to pass your own exceptions pattern.
See \fBgetopt\fP(1) manual page for more information.
.TP
.B "\-r, \-\-root <path>"
Specify alternative installation root (default is "/"). This
should be used if you want to display information about a package
that is installed on a temporary mounted partition, which is "owned"
by another system. By using this option you specify which package
database to use.
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-version"
Print version and exit.
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Print help and exit.
